📌 Introduction
The Smart Timetable Generator is an intelligent and automated solution designed to simplify the complex and time-consuming process of creating academic timetables. Leveraging advanced algorithms, this tool efficiently allocates subjects, teachers, and classrooms, taking into account various constraints and preferences. Our goal is to provide educational institutions with an optimal, clash-free, and balanced schedule, saving valuable administrative hours and resources.

❗️ Problem Statement
Manually creating timetables for educational institutions is a significant challenge. It involves balancing numerous constraints such as teacher availability, classroom capacity, subject requirements, lab sessions, and student preferences. This manual process is often prone to errors, results in scheduling conflicts, and leads to inefficient resource utilization. The lack of an automated system creates a logistical bottleneck at the beginning of every academic year, causing delays and frustration for both staff and students. Our project aims to solve this by providing a robust, web-based platform that automates the entire timetable generation process.

✨ Features
Automated Generation: Intelligently creates optimized timetables with a single click.

Constraint Management: Easily define and manage constraints like teacher availability, classroom capacity, and subject prerequisites.

Clash Detection: Automatically identifies and resolves scheduling conflicts.

Resource Optimization: Ensures efficient allocation of teachers, classrooms, and labs.

Customizable & Flexible: Easily adaptable to different institutional structures and requirements.

User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive and easy-to-navigate dashboard for administrators.

Export & Share: Generate and export timetables in PDF or Excel formats.

Real-time Editing: Manually adjust the generated timetable with a simple drag-and-drop interface.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL

Algorithm: Genetic Algorithms / Constraint Satisfaction Solvers

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Deployment: Docker, AWS / Heroku
