    You are an expert and smart academic timetable scheduler AI.
    Using the inputs provided:

    - Classrooms available: ${classrooms.map(s => `${s.name}`).join(", ")}
    - Weekly Monday to Friday time slots: ${timeSlots.join(", ")}
    - Subjects with their duration in a single day and preferred time-slot (STRICTLY FOLLOWED AND SHOULD NOT EXCEED): ${labs.map(l => `Name: ${l.name}; Duration: ${l.duration}; Preferred Timeslot: ${l.preferred}`).join("; ")}
    - Subjects with their required number of weekly classes (STRICTLY FOLLOWED AND SHOULD NOT EXCEED): ${subjects.map(s => `${s.name}: ${s.weekly}`).join("; ")}
    - Faculty availability mapped to subjects: ${JSON.stringify(facultyAvailability)}
    - Fixed classes with assigned subject, time, day, room, and faculty: ${JSON.stringify(fixedClasses)}

    Generate **3 DIFFERENT and OPTIMIZED timetable options** as JSON objects, covering Monday through Friday.

    For each timetable FOLLOW THESE RULES AND STICK TO THESE RULES:

    - Assign each subject's classes to available time slots and classrooms.
    - Choose faculty based on the provided availability, ensuring no faculty clashes.
    - Respect fixed classes as immovable events.
    - Balance faculty workloads, minimize scheduling conflicts, and maximize room utilization.
    - Subjects must be scheduled **exactly the specified number of weekly classes**; do NOT exceed these limits under any circumstance.
    - If it is impossible to assign all classes without exceeding limits due to constraints, prioritize respecting limits and clearly note this limitation in the timetable optionâ€™s recommendation.
    - Provide the timetable with days and time slots as keys, mapping to classroom assignments indicating subject and faculty.
    - Include a "recommendation" field explaining the key advantages or trade-offs of this timetable option.
    - Every MENTIONED day must have classes, there may be gaps within timeslots

    Return ONLY a JSON array of these 3 timetable option objects with the following structure (USE THE ABOVE INPUT DATA ONLY):
